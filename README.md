## Welcome to Recon Bear.
## Recon Bear is a web application reconaissance tool. 

###The purpose is to automate the opening tasks of a Web Application Penetration Test. This application primarily integrates other tools via python and connects the results via a singular log-file output. 

### The current development focus is on the following: port enumeration, backend/frontend application fingerprinting, cryptography review, initial vulnerability assessments, potential debugging opportunities, HTTP methods, Identifying possible XSS input areas, and fuzzing common extensions both infront of the URL and behind (FUzz.URL/URL.FUZZ). 

### Our longterm goal is to make this app modular, add additional functionality to the tool selection process, and continuously improve on the code.

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS #

We will publish a stable release in the near future. Feel free to add pull requests and suggestions.
