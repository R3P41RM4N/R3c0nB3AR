## Welcome to Recon Bear.

### Recon Bear is a web application reconaissance tool. The purpose is to automate the opening tasks of a Web Application Penetration Test.
### This application primarily integrates other tools via python and connects the results via a singular log-file output. 

### The focus of the tools within the application should be: 
### - Port Enumeration, backend server and front end applications fingerprinting. Review of authentication, ntlm, potential debugging opportunities, reviewing methods, reviewing potential leads on XSS, fuzzing common extensions both infront of the URL and behind (FUzz.URL/URL.FUZZ). 
.
#Our goal is to make this app modular (which it sort of is), add additional functionality to the tool selectrion process and continuously improve on the design.

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS #

We will publish a stable release in the near future. Feel free to add pull requests and suggestions. This is supposed to be opensource.

Hack The Planet!
